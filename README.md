Business analysis project with SQL 

- Provide a table that provides the **region** for each **sales_rep** along with their associated **accounts**. This time only for the 'Midwest' region. Your final table should include three columns: the region **name**, the sales rep **name**, and the account **name**. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, s.name rep, a.name account
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest'
ORDER BY a.name;
```
- Provide a table that provides the **region** for each **sales_rep** along with their associated **accounts**. This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a first name starting with `S` and in the `Midwest region`. Your final table should include three columns: the region **name**, the sales rep **name**, and the account **name**. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, s.name rep, a.name account
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest' AND s.name LIKE 'S%'
ORDER BY a.name;
```
- Provide a table that provides the **region** for each **sales_rep** along with their associated **accounts**. This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a **last** name starting with `K` and in the `Midwest` region. Your final table should include three columns: the region **name**, the sales rep **name**, and the account **name**. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, s.name rep, a.name account
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest' AND s.name LIKE '% K%'
ORDER BY a.name;
