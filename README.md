Here are a few queries used to understand the Parch & Posey database.
- Provide a table that provides the **region** for each **sales_rep** along with their associated **accounts**. This time only for the 'Midwest' region. Your final table should include three columns: the region **name**, the sales rep **name**, and the account **name**. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, s.name rep, a.name account
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest'
ORDER BY a.name;
```
- Provide a table that provides the **region** for each **sales_rep** along with their associated **accounts**. This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a first name starting with `S` and in the `Midwest region`. Your final table should include three columns: the region **name**, the sales rep **name**, and the account **name**. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, s.name rep, a.name account
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest' AND s.name LIKE 'S%'
ORDER BY a.name;
```
- Provide a table that provides the **region** for each **sales_rep** along with their associated **accounts**. This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a **last** name starting with `K` and in the `Midwest` region. Your final table should include three columns: the region **name**, the sales rep **name**, and the account **name**. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, s.name rep, a.name account
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest' AND s.name LIKE '% K%'
ORDER BY a.name;
```
- Provide the **name** for each region for every **order**, as well as the account **name** and the **unit price** they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the **standard order quantity** exceeds `100`. Your final table should have 3 columns: **region name**, **account name**, and **unit price**.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, a.name account, o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01) unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100;
```
- Provide the **name** for each region for every **order**, as well as the account **name** and the **unit price** they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the **standard order quantity** exceeds `100` and the **poster order quantity** exceeds `50`. Your final table should have 3 columns: **region name**, **account name**, and **unit price**. Sort for the smallest **unit price** first.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, a.name account, o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01) unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100 AND o.poster_qty > 50
ORDER BY unit_price;
```
- Provide the **name** for each region for every **order**, as well as the account **name** and the **unit price** they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the **standard order quantity** exceeds `100` and the **poster order quantity** exceeds `50`. Your final table should have 3 columns: **region name**, **account name**, and **unit price**. Sort for the largest **unit price** first.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, a.name account, o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01) unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100 AND o.poster_qty > 50
ORDER BY unit_price DESC;
```
