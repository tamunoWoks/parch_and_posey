Here are a few queries used to understand the Parch & Posey database.
- Write a query to return the 10 earliest orders in the **orders** table. Include the `id`, `occurred_at`, and `total_amt_usd`.
```sql
SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY occurred_at
LIMIT 10;
```
- Write a query to return the top 5 **orders** in terms of largest `total_amt_usd`. Include the `id`, `account_id`, and `total_amt_usd`.
```sql
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```
- Write a query to return the lowest 20 **orders** in terms of smallest `total_amt_usd`. Include the `id`, `account_id`, and `total_amt_usd`.
 ```sql
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd
LIMIT 20;
```
- Write a query that displays the order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for all the orders, sorted first by the account ID (in ascending order), and then by the total dollar amount (in descending order).
```sql
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY account_id, total_amt_usd DESC;
```
- Now write a query that again displays order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for each order, but this time sorted first by total dollar amount (in descending order), and then by account ID (in ascending order).
```sql
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC, account_id;
```
- Pulls the first 5 rows and all columns from the orders table that have a dollar amount of gloss_amt_usd greater than or equal to 1000.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE gloss_amt_usd >= 1000
LIMIT 5;
```
- Pulls the first 10 rows and all columns from the orders table that have a total_amt_usd less than 500.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE total_amt_usd < 500
LIMIT 10;
```
- Provide a table that provides the **region** for each **sales_rep** along with their associated **accounts**. This time only for the 'Midwest' region. Your final table should include three columns: the region **name**, the sales rep **name**, and the account **name**. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, s.name rep, a.name account
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest'
ORDER BY a.name;
```
- Provide a table that provides the **region** for each **sales_rep** along with their associated **accounts**. This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a first name starting with `S` and in the `Midwest region`. Your final table should include three columns: the region **name**, the sales rep **name**, and the account **name**. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, s.name rep, a.name account
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest' AND s.name LIKE 'S%'
ORDER BY a.name;
```
- Provide a table that provides the **region** for each **sales_rep** along with their associated **accounts**. This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a **last** name starting with `K` and in the `Midwest` region. Your final table should include three columns: the region **name**, the sales rep **name**, and the account **name**. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, s.name rep, a.name account
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest' AND s.name LIKE '% K%'
ORDER BY a.name;
```
- Provide the **name** for each region for every **order**, as well as the account **name** and the **unit price** they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the **standard order quantity** exceeds `100`. Your final table should have 3 columns: **region name**, **account name**, and **unit price**.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, a.name account, o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01) unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100;
```
- Provide the **name** for each region for every **order**, as well as the account **name** and the **unit price** they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the **standard order quantity** exceeds `100` and the **poster order quantity** exceeds `50`. Your final table should have 3 columns: **region name**, **account name**, and **unit price**. Sort for the smallest **unit price** first.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, a.name account, o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01) unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100 AND o.poster_qty > 50
ORDER BY unit_price;
```
- Provide the **name** for each region for every **order**, as well as the account **name** and the **unit price** they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the **standard order quantity** exceeds `100` and the **poster order quantity** exceeds `50`. Your final table should have 3 columns: **region name**, **account name**, and **unit price**. Sort for the largest **unit price** first.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, a.name account, o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01) unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100 AND o.poster_qty > 50
ORDER BY unit_price DESC;
```
