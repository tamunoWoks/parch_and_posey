## SQL Joins
Here we will try out some examples for different SQL joinss such as `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` and `OUTER JOIN` alongside other concepts like `ALIAS`, Primary keys and Foreign keys.  

**Examples**- Provide a table for all the for all **web_events** associated with account **name** of `Walmart`. There should be three columns. Be sure to include the `primary_poc`, time of the event, and the `channel` for each event. Additionally, you might choose to add a fourth column to assure only `Walmart` events were chosen.
```sql
SELECT a.primary_poc, w.occurred_at, w.channel, a.name
FROM web_events w
JOIN accounts a
ON w.account_id = a.id
WHERE a.name = 'Walmart';
```
- Provide a table that provides the **region** for each **sales_rep** along with their associated **accounts**. This time only for the 'Midwest' region. Your final table should include three columns: the region **name**, the sales rep **name**, and the account **name**. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, s.name rep, a.name account
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest'
ORDER BY a.name;
```
- Provide the **name** for each region for every **order**, as well as the account **name** and the **unit price** they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. Your final table should have 3 columns: **region name**, **account name**, and **unit price**. A few accounts have 0 for **total**, so I divided by (total + 0.01) to assure not dividing by zero.
```sql
 SELECT r.name region, a.name account, 
           o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01) unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id;
```
- Provide a table that provides the **region** for each **sales_rep** along with their associated **accounts**. This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a first name starting with `S` and in the `Midwest region`. Your final table should include three columns: the region **name**, the sales rep **name**, and the account **name**. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, s.name rep, a.name account
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest' AND s.name LIKE 'S%'
ORDER BY a.name;
```
- Provide a table that provides the **region** for each **sales_rep** along with their associated **accounts**. This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a **last** name starting with `K` and in the `Midwest` region. Your final table should include three columns: the region **name**, the sales rep **name**, and the account **name**. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
```sql
SELECT r.name region, s.name rep, a.name account
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
WHERE r.name = 'Midwest' AND s.name LIKE '% K%'
ORDER BY a.name;
```
- Provide the **name** for each region for every **order**, as well as the account **name** and the **unit price** they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the **standard order quantity** exceeds `100`. Your final table should have 3 columns: **region name**, **account name**, and **unit price**.
```sql
SELECT r.name region,
       a.name account,
       o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01) unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100;
```
- Provide the **name** for each region for every **order**, as well as the account **name** and the **unit price** they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the **standard order quantity** exceeds `100` and the **poster order quantity** exceeds `50`. Your final table should have 3 columns: **region name**, **account name**, and **unit price**. Sort for the smallest **unit price** first.
```sql
SELECT r.name region,
       a.name account,
       o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01) unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100 AND o.poster_qty > 50
ORDER BY unit_price;
```
- Provide the **name** for each region for every **order**, as well as the account **name** and the **unit price** they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. However, you should only provide the results if the **standard order quantity** exceeds `100` and the **poster order quantity** exceeds `50`. Your final table should have 3 columns: **region name**, **account name**, and **unit price**. Sort for the largest **unit price** first.
```sql
SELECT r.name region,
       a.name account,
       o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01) unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.standard_qty > 100 AND o.poster_qty > 50
ORDER BY unit_price DESC;
```
- Find all the orders that occurred in 2015. Your final table should have 4 columns: occurred_at, account name, order total, and order total_amt_usd.
```sql
SELECT o.occurred_at, a.name, o.total, o.total_amt_usd
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
WHERE o.occurred_at BETWEEN '01-01-2015' AND '01-01-2016'
ORDER BY o.occurred_at DESC;
```
