Here we will treat the concept of **Window Functions** alongside its associated concepts like `OVER`, `PARTITION BY`, `ROW BETWEEN`, `RANK`, etc.

- Let us calculate the running total of `standard_qty` orders, agrregating them by each month.
```sql
SELECT standard_qty,
	DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) AS month,
	SUM(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) 
		ORDER BY occurred_at) AS running_total
FROM orders
```
- Let's create another running total of `standard_amt_usd` (in the `orders` table) over order time with no date truncation. The final table should have two columns: one with the amount being added for each new row, and a second with the running total.
